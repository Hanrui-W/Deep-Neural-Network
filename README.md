# Deep-Neural-Network
This is a neural network module implemented through Numpy. The model was tested on the MNIST data set of hand-written digits created by Yann LeCun. 
The origin data can be found at http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/. The module used backpropagation for learning. However, it does not include regularization
and it cannot counter vanishing gradients.
